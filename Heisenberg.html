            <p class="max4"><strong>A</strong>ttempting to associate atomic quantum numbers and energy states with
             frequencies and brightness of light spectra, <strong>Werner Heisenberg</strong> demonstrated that energy
            states were quantized and stationary in the Bohr atom.  With mathematical assistance from
            Max Born, a functional model of quantum (matrix) mechanics was achieved.
