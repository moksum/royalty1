            <p class="regnum2"><strong>T</strong>he photograph of the physicists who participated in the 5th Solvay Conference has been 
          described as the most intelligent gathering of people in history.  17 of the 29 individuals
          were recipients of the Nobel Prize, and included such household names as Einstein, Bohr, 
          Curie, Planck, and Heisenberg. So striking was the richness of the company that the photo
          was equated with an anachronistic gathering of Archimedes, Kepler, Newton, and Galileo.
          Often overshadowed by the photo, is the profound impact of the few papers that were actually
          presented.  More on the photo. put  a link.
