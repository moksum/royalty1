            <p class="regnum2"><strong>T</strong>he photograph of the physicists who participated in the 5th Solvay Conference has been 
          described as the most intelligent gathering of people in history.  17 of the 29 individuals
          were recipients of the Nobel Prize, and included such household names as Einstein, Bohr, 
          Curie, Planck, and Heisenberg. So striking was the richness of the company that the photo
          has been equated with an anachronistic gathering of Archimedes, Kepler, Newton, and Galileo.</p>
             <p class="lynx"><strong>Often overshadowed by the photo,</strong> is the profound impact of the few papers that were actually
          presented. The equations which predict the outcome of quantum mechanical processes are all 
          uncontroversial.  However the underlying explanations of that outcome, interpretations of quantum
          theory, are still very controversial.  The 3 speakers framed to the right--in less than 2 days--
          provided the substance for 100 years of that controversy.</p>
