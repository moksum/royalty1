My motivation was to make a junior high level introduction to the 1927 Solvay Conference-
and stress that the most important feature of the meeting was not the participants photograph, but that
all of quantum theory was essentially laid out in just 3 lectures.

The 1927 Solvay Conference, also known as the 5th Solvay Conference, was held in Brussels,
Belgium, 24-29, October 1927.  The conference topic was "Electrons and Photons".

The 5th Solvay is most famous for the photograph of participants, frequently referred to
as the "most intelligent photograph in history".  17 of the 29 in the photograph were 
recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics.
 
I don't have any previous experience with coding and used simple html, css, javascript, and jquery--as these languages were introduced in treehouse.

So, objectively:
The project contains HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT/JQUERY.

The landing page and linked pages are RESPONSIVE, horizontally and vertically.

The project is INTERACTIVE, one javascript click event, two jquery text mouseovers, and three jquery background color hovers----are on the landing page.

The HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT/JQUERY pages have been COMMENTED.


Thank you for your time in reviewing this project.
